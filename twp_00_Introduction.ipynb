    "Before we start, I'd like to tell you about why I use Python for\n",
    "financial computing. It took me several years to get a grasp of all the\n",
    "options out there and I will try to convince you that Python is really\n",
    "the best tool for most of the tasks involved in trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I started programming as a kid somewhere in the early nineties,\n",
    "choosing a programming language was easy, as there were simply not many\n",
    "to choose from. I first started in Pascal and since then have programmed\n",
    "in Delphi, C, C++, C\\#,Java , VB, PHP, Matlab, Python, SPIN and even\n",
    "ASM. I did not learn all these languages for fun, as I have better\n",
    "things to do (like actual work), but I needed to as I had no \"swiss army\n",
    "knife\" language for all my needs. I needed C and Delphi for making\n",
    "stand-alone applications, PHP to build a website and Matlab for\n",
    "scientific calculations. As the saying goes, \"jack of all trades is\n",
    "master of none\" , so by switching from one language to another I never\n",
    "acquired expert knowledge in any of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, I would like learn only *one* language that is suited for all\n",
    "kinds of work: number crunching, application building, web development,\n",
    "interfacing with APIs etc. This language would be easy to learn, the\n",
    "code would be compact and clear, it would run on any platform. It would\n",
    "enable me to work interactively, enabling the code to evolve as I write\n",
    "it and be at least free as in speech. And most importantly, I care much\n",
    "more about my own time than the cpu time of my pc, so number crunching\n",
    "performance is less important for me than my own productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today two most popular languages for technical and scientific computing\n",
    "are Matlab and Python. Both of them satisfy many of the wishes described\n",
    "above, but they have some important differences. *Matlab* is most\n",
    "popular when it comes to technical computing. This is what I used to use\n",
    "day-to-day for solving engineering problems. For numeric simulations and\n",
    "working with \"clean\" data, it is probably the best tool there is. Good\n",
    "IDE, fantastic plotting functions, great documentation. It is less well\n",
    "suited for application development or as a general purpose language.\n",
    "Expect to pay \\~2k\\$ for a basic commercial license plus extra for\n",
    "specific toolboxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing financial research in Matlab has proven to be quite a challenge\n",
    "for me, mainly because there is no easy way of handling \"dirty\" data\n",
    "(data that is not nicely aligned in a table, but has multiple sources\n",
    "with different dates and missing entries). Another challenge that I\n",
    "faced was keeping my code from becoming a mess. It is possible to write\n",
    "neat libraries with Matlab, but is far from trivial and the language\n",
    "design actually encourages messy coding. While using Matlab for trading\n",
    "strategy development I was able to deal with the shortcomings of this\n",
    "platform. However, when I decided to build an automatic trading system,\n",
    "I had hit a dead end. While I was able to connect to Interacive Brokers\n",
    "API, it turned out that there was no way to create a reliable\n",
    "application. While good for research, Matlab sucks for deployment. This\n",
    "was when I decided to look at other options. *Python* is very similar to\n",
    "Matlab and solves most of its shortcomings. And is free! With Ipython\n",
    "notebook interactive work in Python is just easy as in Matlab, but what\n",
    "you get is a programming language that can complete almost any task,\n",
    "from data mining to web development and production quality applications\n",
    "with great GUIs. If I\"d have to start all over again, I would choose\n",
    "Python as it would save me the trouble of learning another language for\n",
    "Gui and web development. After using Python for three years, I am still\n",
    "as enthusiastic as the moment I have fallen in love with it. I feel that\n",
    "many other traders can greatly benefit by learning Python from the start\n",
    "and for this reason I have set up a Trading With Python course.\n",

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which version to use?\n",
    "\n",
    "While Python 3 was released in 2008, version 2.7 is still being widely\n",
    "used. There is nothing wrong with 2.7, as it is stable and functional,\n",
    "but 3.x is has a number of improvements that are important for software\n",
    "developers, but not less relevant for scientific/financial applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is good to learn the right thing from the start, so this course is\n",
    "based around *Python 3.x*\n",
    "\n",
    "So, please, go ahead and install\n",
    "[Anaconda](http://www.continuum.io/downloads)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Essential tools\n",
    "\n",
    "To edit and run the code, you'll need at least three development tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "|Tool  | Usage | Included with Anaconda |\n",
    "| ------------- | ------------- |\n",
    "| Jupyter notebook  | quick prototyping and data exploration. | yes |\n",
    "| Spyder IDE  | writing modules and scripts  | yes |\n",
    "| text editor | editing configuration files etc. | no |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing Anaconda, you'll need to choose a good browser (Jupyter notebook does not work in Explorer) and a text editor. For the latter I recommend [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've got those, you should be ready to go!\n",
