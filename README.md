# Trading With Python course

**Now open source!**

The course material consists of 'notebooks' that contain text together with interactive code like this one. 
You will be able to learn by interacting with the code and modifying it to your own liking. It will be a great starting point for writing your own strategies

While some topics are explained in great detail to help you understand the underlying concepts, 
in most cases you won't even need to write your own low-level code, because of support by existing open-source libraries :
[TradingWithPython](https://github.com/sjev/trading-with-python) library combines much of the functionality discussed in this course as a ready-to-use functions and will be used throughout the course. 
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) will provide you with all of the heavy-lifting power needed in data crunching.
